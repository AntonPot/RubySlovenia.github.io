This is our **new webpage**. It's not perfect but it'll do just fine.

We had a great meetup yesterday with two awesome talks: **Jan Brdo** (@mrbrdo) talked about Design Patterns in Ruby and **Damjan Rems** explained why MongoDB & Ruby are a match made in heaven. To wrap up I introduced donations in the form of [awesome stickers](/stickers). A [lot of you responded](/donations) and I thank you all! After that we continued our debates at the nearest bar where [DÂ·Labs](http://dlabs.si/) bought us all a drink.

Our next monthly meetup is still a long time away, so this month we're doing something *special*. We've teamed up with the **legendary** [Rubyburgers](http://rubyburgers.co/) and we're bringing them to **Ljubljana**! So on 8th of May we'll have a [casual meetup](http://www.meetup.com/RubySlovenia/events/179183292/) over some great food.

There will be *stickers*, and there will be *burgers*. **Hood burgers**!
