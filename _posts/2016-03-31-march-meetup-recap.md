March brought us springtime, sunshine, and another Ruby meetup. 

[Lenart Rudel](https://github.com/lenart) presented [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org), a fresh take on web development in Ruby. Hanami is an alternative web framework that focuses on simplicity, performance, explicitness over magic, object-oriented architecture and testability. He discussed the differences between Rails and Hanami, its benefits, the viability of using it in production, and some code examples.

[Oto Brglez](http://otobrglez.opalab.com) gave a lightning talk on [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/), a time-series database. He demonstrated how to implement page view analytics with graphs over time.

[Jan Berdajs](https://github.com/mrbrdo) presented [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), which allows you to expose your local development server to the internet. This is very useful for demoing your app or testing webhooks.

After the talks, beers were had and opinions were exchanged.

Thanks everyone for coming! We'd also like to thank our sponsors [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com), [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si) and [V Å¾ivo](http://vzivo.si).

See you [next time](http://www.meetup.com/RubySlovenia/)! In the meantime, we can also chat on our [Slack](http://slack.rug.si/).
