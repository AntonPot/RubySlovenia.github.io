The month is coming to an end and that means that our [monthly meetup](http://www.meetup.com/RubySlovenia/events/182420662/) is coming around. This meetup is going to be a little different. *Again*. We're moving the meetup to **Monday** and to a **new location**. *Again*. :pensive:

After the talks part is over we usually sit down at the bar tables with the *people we already know*. You know - programmers are introverted and all that. The problem is that you **don't get to meet new people** or **exchange your ideas with someone you don't know**. Another problem is that **someone** (you know who :grin:) starts talking about bitcoins and there is no way you can switch tables now. *Fuck!*

Easy solution? No tables. So from now on we're teamed up with [Poligon Creative Centre](http://poligon.si/). Poligon is a great place for *coworking* and for events like this. It has a very *relaxed atmosphere* which will lead to many new Ruby friendships. **I'm sure of it**. :tada:

For the meetup: We'll have a guest from *across the narrow sea*. **Don Goodman-Wilson** from the [ScreenHero](http://screenhero.com/) team will be joining us to do a *very interesting talk*, provocatively titled **Screenhero: Get Shit Done**. Some of you already met him at the [Rubyburgers meetup]({% post_url 2014-05-09-burgers %}), but this time you'll all get to hear what he has to say. The second talk will be done by **Å½iga Vidic** who has yet to come up with a title.

After the talks we'll do a public debate on why **#TDDisDead** and what to do with our lives now. When the debate will start going south, we'll move to the bar and *drink in desperation*.

Looking forward to another great meetup!

P.S.: Bring friends :wink:
