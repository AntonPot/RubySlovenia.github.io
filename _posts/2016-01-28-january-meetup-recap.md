2016 will be an outstanding year so we started it with some awesome topics. [Jan "Brdo" Berdajs](https://github.com/mrbrdo), CTO at [RankTrackr](http://ranktrackr.net/) presented some cool new features in Rails 5 which is comming out this year. Yeey!!

After Jan's talk we had an opportunity to listen to Dane Å oba, CTO at [Megabon](http://megabon.eu/). Dane was talking about making Rails as fast as possible and how to detect and resolve slow chunks of the code.

The end of the meetup was fired up by a lightning talk. [Miha Rekar](http://twitter.com/mr_foto) showed us some quick hacks which makes our terminal window fancier than ever. [Check out his tips](http://mr.si/posts/2016/01/29/dont-screw-up-when-you-ssh-to-production/) to never again screw up something on production server.


The event was unofficially continued with free drinks and many interesting conversations about Ruby, job opportunities and life-hacks.
