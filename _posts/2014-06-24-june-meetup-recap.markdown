Last gathering before summer holidays took place on Monday, 23th of June. Again, we've had two brave souls sharing their knowledge with the rest of us, curious Rubyists.

The first one was a young gun from [D·Labs](http://dlabs.si/) Martin Artnik (@artoartnik) with a presentation titled "Useless gems". Speakers usually want us to believe they've found or did something better. But this time, Arto didn't try that. He dropped his favorite gems that no one really needs while [making the world a better place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5lYveEZEFo&t=6). And why do we even have and talk about useless gems? Because we can and because it's fun. Arto also showed us his [geoeras gem](https://github.com/artoartnik/geoeras). It can make historians pretty happy, writing their history driven development. My personal favorite useless gem was [dicks](http://rubygems.org/gems/dicks), it's really hot so check it out.

And then Tomaž Zaman (@carmivore) from [codeable.io](https://codeable.io/) set the fire on stage with his talk about [Continuous deployment of Rails apps on AWS OpsWorks](http://www.slideshare.net/tomazzaman/deploy-to). We were introduced to their product [codeable.io](https://codeable.io/) which connects [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) specialists with clients. They have a modern stack where Rails is providing a JSON API on server side and [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) displaying it on client side. They're using [Travis.ci](https://travis-ci.org/) for Continuous Integration, [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) for communication (they are remote team), [HuBot](https://hubot.github.com/),… and many more. These guys are doing some serious automation in every possible aspect. I can already see Tomaž doing his v2.0 presentation about HuBot being their scrum master, moving their [Trello](http://trello.com) cards, scraping the logs and fixing bugs live in production with `below-zero-downtime`. But the main part of his talk was how they've successfully moved to [AWS OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) and what they did to get there.
