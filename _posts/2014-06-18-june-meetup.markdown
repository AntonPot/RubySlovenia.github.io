It's almost meetup time of month again. Yaaay!!! :tada:

We moved this meetup to Monday, because Wednesday is a national holiday and we figured you might use that for an extended weekend. :sunglasses:

The meetup will again take place in the [**Poligon Creative Centre**](http://www.poligon.si/). Everyone seemed to really like the place so we can finally say we settled on the location for all of our future meetups.

The first talk of the meetup will be by **Martin Artnik** (@artoartnik) from [**D·Labs**](http://dlabs.si/), who is still deciding on the topic. The second one will be by **Tomaž Zaman** (@carmivore) from [**Codeable**](https://codeable.io/) on *Continuous deployment of Rails apps on AWS OpsWorks*.

This might be our last proper meetup for a while, because we know you all scatter to the coast during summertime. We will probably still meet for a :beer: or even [Rubyburgers]({% post_url 2014-05-09-burgers %}) but no details yet.

Looking forward to another great meetup!

P.S.: Bring friends :wink:
