[Tina Tavčar](http://www.tinatavcar.com/) designed this really awesome logo for our group that merges the two loves of our life: *Ruby* and *Slovenia*. And there is nothing more Slovenian than our [national symbol Triglav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglav#National_symbol). Of course you want to wear this with pride on all of your stuff, which is why we made **stickers**.

They are so awesome that you'll want to stick them everywhere, so we decided we'll let [stickermule](http://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=0576840701) make them. That means that not only they look **amazing**, they are also able to withstand exposure to [wind, rain, sunlight, and they're even **dishwasher safe**](http://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/knj2iwmum4?autoPlay=true)[^1].

Now that wasn't cheap, and there are some other expenses with the group (meetup.com subscription fee, domain name,…) which is why we sell them for **€1 per sticker**. *10%* of the income goes towards [Rails Girls SoC](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)[^2], while the other *90%* covers our expenses. Basically it's a **donation** for this group that gives you stickers in return. How **awesome** is that?

You can get them at all of our [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/RubySlovenia/) or we can send them to you via snail mail[^3] - just [let us know](mailto:info@rug.si).

This is how they look:
